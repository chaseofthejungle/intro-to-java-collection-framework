# Intro to the Java Collections Framework
  
**Definition/Overview:** The *Java Collections Framework (JCF)* is an architecture of Java interfaces and classes that can be utilized to implement and reuse collection-based data structures. Examples of JCF interfaces include Lists, Maps, and Sets, while examples of JCF classes include ArrayLists, HashMaps, and HashSets.

TODO: Add the following sections: ArrayLists vs. LinkedLists, HashSets vs. TreeSets, HashMaps vs. Hashtables, HashMaps vs. ConcurrentHashMaps, Comparables vs. Comparators, List Iteration Approaches.
